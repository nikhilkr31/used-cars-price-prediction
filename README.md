# [What drives the price of a car?](https://nikhilkr31.github.io/used-cars-price-prediction/)
## Overview
In this notebook, we will be exploring the [Used Car dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data) from Kaggle. This dataset contains around 427k transaction records from Craigslist.

From the creator of the dataset we know that the data is scraped every few months, it contains most all relevant information that Craigslist provides on car sales including columns like price, condition, manufacturer, etc.

Our goal for this project will be to explore the factors which determine the price of a car. Assuming that we are making recommendations to a used car dealership on how to appropriately price their cars i.e what consumers value in a used car.
